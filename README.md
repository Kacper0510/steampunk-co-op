## Installation

To install the pack, I recommend using **[packwiz-installer](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer/)** (click the link for tutorial).

Necessary files are hosted as a GitHub Pages site, so you can skip the step with `packwiz serve`. Just use `https://kacper0510.github.io/steampunk-co-op/pack.toml` as a server in the pre-launch command.

## Final notes

This pack was made for me and my friends - use it at your own risk.
I do not guarantee that I will help with any problems which might arise in the future.

Also, I have no idea whether the pack will receive any updates for the next versions of Minecraft because it heavily depends on bundled mods and their authors' will to update.
